## KrakenPHP Framework

KrakenPHP is the first and only multi-processed, multi-threaded, fault-tolerant framework for PHP. It has been written
to provide easy and reliable API for creating distributed applications using PHP. KrakenPHP aims to solve typical 
problems of writing such applications and to provide developers with powerful yet elegant tools for dealing with them. 

The main focus of KrakenPHP is put on: 
* Concurrency and distribution
Create systems that are asynchronous and distributed by design. Run them on multiple threads, processors or hosts
and manage from single place.
* Error-tolerant design
Write systems that self-heal using remote and local supervision hierarchies.
* Elasticity
Keep business logic of your applications inside universal containers and connections between them separately. Modify
existing architecture and number of running containers in realtime without need to change in code.
* High performance
Handle up to thousands of simultaneous connections per second on single container. Use multiple containers on several 
processors and/or hosts to push it even further.
* Extensibility
Use available options to easily extend and adapt framework features for your needs.

Then again, start writing applications that were previously marked as impossible or hard to implement in PHP right know. 
Servers, service-oriented architecture, agent-based models, games, complex daemons, socket programs, schedulers 
and much, much more - nothing is impossible with KrakenPHP!
